ðŸ”¥ New Robust Algorithms to Add

Random Forest Signal Generator

Works well with tabular data (technical indicators, features).

Can classify BUY / SELL / HOLD based on engineered features.

Robust to noise and nonlinear patterns.

LSTM Neural Network Signal Generator

Sequential model â†’ captures temporal dependencies in price data.

Often beats ARIMA in practice for non-linear time series.

Good for detecting turning points and regime changes.

XGBoost / Gradient Boosting Signal Generator

Handles non-linear relationships well.

Great for imbalanced data (BUY vs SELL signals).

Widely used in finance competitions (Kaggle, etc.).

Kalman Filter Trend Estimator

Very robust to noise in price series.

Estimates underlying "true" trend â†’ useful for adaptive strategies.
